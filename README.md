# NYC taxi & Uber Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing taxi and Uber ride data from January 2020 to August 2024 in New York City. By joining this data with historical weather records, the project aims to answer specific questions using a combination of SQL queries and data visualizations. <br>
This project involves downloading and cleaning the datasets, storing relevant information in a SQLite database, and providing insights through data analysis. 

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Storage**: Processes and filters raw data from the TLC website into clean formats, samples relevant data, and stores it in a SQLite database for efficient querying.
- **Data Analysis**: Queries and processes data from taxi and Uber trips, then combines with weather records to understand ride preferences and trip details in different weather conditions. 

- **Data Visualization**: Generates various plots based on SQL queries, including bar plots, scatter plots, line plots, and heatmaps, to illustrate and visualize insights.

## Data Sources
1. **Trip Data**: Yellow Taxi and Uber trip data are from [TLC Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). This project only includes trip data spanning from January 2020 through August 2024. The shapefile used to convert location IDs and geographical coordinates can also be found on this website.

2. **Weather Data**: Historical weather data are from [local climatological data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/local-climatological-data?stations=72505394728), the data spans from 2020 through October 2024.
